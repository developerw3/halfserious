# Halfserious Project

- This **Halfserious** project was built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This app leverages various modern web technologies and APIs, including Redux for state management, Unsplash API for images, and Star Wars API for film data.
- This is a scalable, responsive Web Application.

## Features

- **React-based UI**: Built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), leveraging the power of functional components, hooks, and context.
- **State Management**: Uses [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for efficient state management.
- **UI Components**: The app uses [MDB React UI Kit](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/react/) based on Material Design and Bootstrap for the UI.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailored for all devices with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for custom styling.
- **Font Awesome Icons**: Integrated for UI enhancements.
- **APIs**: Consumes data from the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) for film-related data and the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) for images.
